This week, I used AI mainly to help me with my project. I asked it to give me a clear structure I could follow to stay organized and complete everything on time. 
The AI suggested breaking my project into three stages: planning, implementation, and testing/documentation. I also asked for ideas for functions I could include, and it helped me come up with options like add_record(), search_record(), update_record(), and validate_id().  In addition, I told the AI to explain a few programming concepts I didn’t understand, such as the difference between validation and debugging. It explained that validation prevents errors before they happen, 
while debugging fixes them after they occur. 
The AI also showed me how to write proper docstrings for my functions. Overall, using AI made it easier to plan my project, understand coding concepts, and stay on track . Here is the chat for it https://chatgpt.com/c/69093b55-aad0-832c-b1ba-92d6aebdfeae
