week 1 
This week, I used AI while working on the exercise for this week to understand some concepts. The concept 
I didn't understand at all how to combine while loops and lists together. Here is my chat with AI, plus I didn't use AI for coding 
or dubbing at all   https://chatgpt.com/c/68cecd3f-798c-8331-a1ce-e3b760118ea4 

My project team also uses AI to help with our project charter. we told it to create rubric 
So we can satisfy the requirement, which also asks to be organized in a systematic form. 
Finally, I tried a new AI called Gemini to see if i provided the same prompt as ChatGPT would give the same things, but provide 
a whole different things, which made kind of sense but not much. Here is the chat
